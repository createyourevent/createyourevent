<h1 jhiTranslate="about-us.title">About us</h1>
<p jhiTranslate="about-us.info">
'Create Your Event' is a sub-organization of 'Heartfull-Mind' on 3 levels. In other words, this unit is already subordinate to the sub-organization 'Create Your Ideas'. We also put this idea in the Hearfull Mind forest for the simple reason that we share the same values ​​and ideologies.
The idea of ​​'Create Your Event' also came about as part of 'Create Your Ideas', a platform which can be seen as a kind of ideas forge. The point is that we try to build a variety of ideas (small use cases and business cases) in a funnel-shaped structure, a kind of network of ideas that has adopted a great deal of project and development procedures from IT and adapted them to the public market. Furthermore, these ideas are simply connected to one another, but simply in a logical arrangement, since the ideas are based on one another, and so a logical chain results. This results in a logical network of ideas, which brings with it a kind of evolution, as it is designed like a game to grow meaningfully and logically.

Create Your Event now aims to simplify the event planning process by bringing all parties involved in an event together at a kind of virtual round table. We hope that we want to democratize the event process in a way in which all parties in the organization of this event can participate virtually and thus have a say in how the event should look at the end.

The idea is described in detail on the homepage of www.createyourevent.org and how it works exactly.
