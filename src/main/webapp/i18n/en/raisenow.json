Therefore we ask you to give us a small amount of money so that we can at least cover the expenses. We would be really connected to you. So that we can expand this platform for all kinds of events and offer you a more interesting right of participation and planning feeling. \n We would like to thank you very much in advance for everything. It is important to us to make the event planning process safer, more attractive and more democratic for everyone. \n \n With best regards \n Urs Baumann, CEO of the 'Create Your Event' family \n \n Be love, be peace and be true.",
