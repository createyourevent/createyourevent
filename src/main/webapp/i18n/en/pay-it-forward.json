    "info": "We have developed a Pay It Forward system for Create Your Event, in which we pay a certain percentage of all feeable income to event organizers. This means that everyone who organizes an event with us receives a percentage of all fees that we incur for their event as a deposit. We charge 13% for the successful sale of products, the successful offering of a service, the successful completion of an event and for the successful booking of an organization. We now add up all the fees and pay a variable percentage, usually around 3%, to our organizers for the event you plan and advertise with us.",
